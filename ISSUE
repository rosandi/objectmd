- LOP has problem with big crystal using VerletList.

- TODO: for multi element simulation, potential calculation
  may have different cut_radius. consider using radius matrix!
  (i.e. cutsq[A][B] for atom type A and B)

- CASE: using MDSystemGrid
  @CreateSystem: import crystal position, set temperature
  temperature is zeroed befor running!
+ SOLVED! Double call to creation function...


! Loop algorithm is changed.
  An iterator my provide two types of loops: half-loop and full-loop.
  half-loop: pair looping, each atoms are visited only once in the loop.
  full-loop: each atoms are visited twice, using a full neighbor list.
             i.e. interaction between atom 0-1 is called, as well as
             interaction between atom 1-0.
  The function Iterator::Iterate() calls both loops. The loop-mode is
  checked in the force-kernel to decide which mode is currently running.

  A looping gadget (e.g. detectors) should call directly IterateHalf()
  of IterateFull() functions, unless it needs both to be called sequentially.
  Integrator calls Iterate() function. So the loop-mode may be 
  activate/deactivate by Iterator::Enable/DisableHalf/FullLoop().


- @WAP: failed using 32 procs! 8 is OK. The problem comes from the atom
  group distribution routine. Failed when group has no member! e.g. 
  damped boundary -> procs @center has no boundary group member -> seg.fault!
  To check: MDSystemGrid::DistributeContainers(), AtomKeeper::IndexBook,
            AtomKeeper::AsignByIndex()
