- LOP has problem with big crystal using VerletList.
- TODO: for multi element simulation, potential calculation
  may have different cut_radius. consider using radius matrix!
  (i.e. cutsq[A][B] for atom type A and B)
- CASE: using MDSystemGrid
  @CreateSystem: import crystal position, set temperature
  temperature is zeroed befor running!

! Loop algorithm is changed.
  An iterator my provide two types of loops: half-loop and full-loop.
  half-loop: pair looping, each atoms are visited only once in the loop.
  full-loop: each atoms are visited twice, using a full neighbor list.
             i.e. interaction between atom 0-1 is called, as well as
             interaction between atom 1-0.
  The function Iterator::Iterate() calls both loops. The loop-mode is
  checked in the force-kernel to decide which mode is currently running.

  A looping gadget (e.g. detectors) should call directly IterateHalf()
  of IterateFull() functions, unless it needs both to be called sequentially.
  Integrator calls Iterate() function. So the loop-mode may be 
  activate/deactivate by Iterator::Enable/DisableHalf/FullLoop().
