@page parallel On Parallel Object-MD

Parallel version of Object-MD is implemented by MDSystemGrid class.
To an application program this class has an identical function to its serial 
counterpart MDSystem. The class works both using single processor and
multi processor, but in contrast to MDSystem it utilizes a communication
handler, CommunicationHandler. The system creation is handled differently.
Only the root process creates the complete simulation atoms by calling the
CreateSystem() function. The root distributes the atoms to all processors
by generating a binary file in BinDirectory (pomd). Later on, every processor
reads the atoms assigned for it from this directory, including the root it self.
This also means all assignment takes place in CreateSystem() function will
apply only to the root processor.

The root is also responsible to arrange the processors to the processor neighbor
list, named the rubik (NeigRubix). To every processor is given a matrix of its neighbor, consisting 26 elements,
arranged by geometrical coordinates of the neighbors. The rubik matrix is
arranged in three slabs; top, middle, and bottom slabs.

Grid rubik arrangement, inside the rectangular bracket is the index:
@code
top:
        n
   [24][25][26]
 w [21][22][23] e
   [18][19][20]
        s
 
middle:
        n
   [15][16][17]
 w [12][13][14] e
   [09][10][11]
        s
 
bottom:
        n
   [06][07][08]
 w [03][04][05] e
   [00][01][02]
        s
@endcode

n, s, e, w stands for north, south, east, and west, respectively.
The element number 13 is the "SELF" processor. If there is no neighboring processor,
i.e. in non periodic case, a negative value is set to the element.

MDSystemGrid requires the main program arguments (argc, argv). These arguments
can be passed to the constructor or explicitly calling SetArgument() function in the
application program.

@section communicator The communicator

A communicator plays a central role in the parallel version. The communicator is
a special conditioner (CommunicationHandler), which has type pre-integration and
force-modifier in the same time. Both conditioner functions are used to synchronize 
the particle data between processors.

A parallel compliant gadget can be created by using double inheritance of
the gadget class and a special ParallelGadget class. The new gadget class
inherites the properties and methods to perform communication between
processor. Before this capabilities is available, the ParallelGadget::Init()
must be called in its Init() function. Fail to do so will cause strange run
time behaviour. The following is an example:

@code
class NewParallelDetector:: public Detector, public ParallelGadget {
  ...

  void Init(MDSystem *WorkSys) {
    Detector::Init(WorkSys);
    ParallelGadget::Init(WorkSys);
    ...

  }

...
};
@endcode

See the methods of ParallelGadget for the list of available functions. For
further example see ThermoDetector, SysMonitor and RestartSaver.

@section restartvar The restart variable

When the SaveSimulation() function is invoked, all the important variables are
stored to the omd binary file. The file is used to continue the simulation
from the point it was saved. This functionality is enabled by the LoadSimulation()
function.

In the parallel version, only the root process loads the variables. Then, they
are synchronized in the MDSystemGrid::CreationFunction(). When a gadget needs
to save a variable, it must register it as a restart variable, using RestartVariable()
function. The function accepts the name and variable to be saved. 
The data may be of type integer of double which is fed to a DataSlot. MDGadget will
scan the variable by its name on program initialization. So, it is necessary to
give a unique name. The variable is not only registered for saving, but it is also
loaded by the saved value on RESTART_MODE. A restart variable is saved in string form, 
so it may lose its precission. For example, see the initialization function of 
DataDumper class.
