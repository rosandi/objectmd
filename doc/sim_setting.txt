@page simsetting The Simulation Settings

The settings of an MD simulation take place inside MDSystem::SystemSetting()
function. This is an abstract function, that must be implemented
in the user application. The application can set some variables,
such as the maximum simulation time, MaxTime (obligatory), the boundary setting
(periodic, non-periodic), the border offset in periodic boundary condition, etc. 
Some system variables may also be changed before the simulation is executed 
(simulation box, name, output directory, writting mode, etc).

Example:

@code
void SystemSetting() {
  SetBoundaryCondition(PERIODIC_X|PERIODIC_Y|PERIODIC_Z);
  SetMaxTime(1.0);
  BorderOffset(offset);
  SetWriteMode(WM_FORCE|WM_ID);
}
@endcode

In this example we apply full periodic boundary condition, the maximum
simulation time is 1.0 (normally pico-second), setting the border offset
with variable offset (some fractions of lattice constant), and the last
setting the write mode (by DumpAtoms() function) which tells the system
to write also the forces and atom ids as data fields. Note that the boundary
and maximum simulation time settings defined in the parameter file has higher
priority. The setting in this function is ignored if the corresponding
parameter exist. See the discussion about @link parameter parameters@endlink
for details.

\section wtd What to do before and after simulation loop?

To perform some processes before and after the simulation loop, an application
must reimplement the BeforeRun() and AfterRun() function. For example,
one may dump the system atoms to file, printing system information, simulation
time, etc. The following is an example,

@code
void BeforeRun() {
	PrintInfo(std::cerr); 
	DumpAtoms("init.data");
}

void AfterRun() {
	PrintTime(std::cerr);
	SaveSimulation();
}
@endcode
