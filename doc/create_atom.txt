/**
@page create_atom Creating Simulation Atoms

The simulation atoms (SystemAtoms) are created in the MDSystem::CreateSystem() function.
An atom class is inserted into the simulation using AddAtom() command, which
take a reference of type AtomContainer. To the added atom class is given a unique id,
in the order of the calling sequence of AddAtom(). The function returns the reference
to the added container.

In this stage the added container may be modified/edited. Some manipulation functions are
available, which normally used in the creation stage:

  - Create()
  - Import()
  - Shift()
  - SetKineticEnergy()
  - SetTemperature()
  - SetName()
  - DumpAtoms()
  - Combine()

See the implementation of AtomContainer for a complete reference. Beside the default
constructor, AtomContainer accept a material file name as the constructor parameter.
The material file is stored below $OMD_TABLE (tables) directory, using the prefix "def"
as file name. The class search for the file name automatically, so the user must
supply only the material name as parameter. For example, if "platinum" is given to
the constructor, than the class will search for the file "def.platinum" in the current
directory and then in $OMD_TABLE. A file stored in the current directory has the
highest priority.

The class AtomContainer is inherited by concrete classes to generate
crystal; such as CrystalFCC111, CrystalFCC100, CrystalBCC100, etc, which are
implemented as omd classes below the $OMD_CLASS (include/class) directory. The header file of
the class must be included in the application program. The following are some
examples:

@subsection  single Creating an FCC(100) crystal

The parameters are the number of monolayers (x, y, z)
and the material file.

@code
#include <class/FCC100.hpp>

...
void CreateSystem() {
  AddAtom(new CrystalFCC100(16, 16, 8, "aluminum"))
     ->Create()
     ->SetKineticEnergy(0.8);
}
...
@endcode

@subsection combine Combining two structures

In the following example two containers are combined into one larger container.
The first is shifted and added a velocity @f$10.0~{\sf\AA/ps}@f$ downward. The
constructor of the AtomContainer copies the data from the containers.
In such a way that the perviously created containers can be removed savely.

@code
#include <class/FCC100.hpp>
#include <class/FCC111.hpp>

...
void CreateSystem() {
  CrystalFCC100 a(10,10,10, "platinum");
  a.Create()->Shift(-5.,-5.,50.0)->AddVelocity(0.0, 0.0, -10.0);

  CrystalFCC111 b(10,10,10, "platinum");
  b.Create();
     
  AddAtom(new AtomContainer(a,b))->SetName("system");
}
...
@endcode

Otherwise AddAtom may take the following form, with which
one may add as many containers as he needs:

@code
...
  AddAtom(new AtomContainer)
     ->Combine(a)
     ->Combine(b)
     ->SetName("system");
...
@endcode

If the material file name is not given to the constructor, AtomContainer will take
it from the first combined container.

An atom container must be created first in the function. There are two ways
to create:
  - invoking reimplemented AtomContainer::Create() function. The function must be reimplemented
    by the descendant class. Examples: CrystalFCC111, CrystalFCC100, etc.
  - importing data from the previously created structure using AtomContainer::Import()
    function.
  - Or create directly. To do this, the application must ensure to set AtomContainer::created
    variable to true.

@section import How to import atom data

An atom container takes a plain text file as an import file. The file must contain fields separated
by spaces. By default the first three fields will be read as x, y, and z coordinates of atoms. In
this case all atoms will have zero velocity.

To import another fields, AtomContainer needs a field definition line. The line is put as a
pseudo comment, as follow:

@code
#$ Fields x y z vx vy vz id idx --
@endcode

the fields "x y z" are mandatory, while "vx vy vz" (velocity components) and "id idx" (atom ids)
are optional. The order is arbitrary but must be consistent with the data fields. Import() will 
search the right fields accordingly. The field definition line must be terminated by double dash
"--".

If the "Material" pseudo comment exists, Import() will read the material properties from the
corresponding material file, if they are not assigned previously. Example:

@code
#$ Material platinum
@endcode

in this case the properties will be read from file "def.platinum" in the current directory, or,
if it is not found, under the $OMD_TABLE. The values those are assigned, are the atomic number (Z)
and the mass (M). The name of the class is also set to the defined element name in the "def" file.
An example to import a crystal data file in CreateSystem():

@code
AddAtom(new AtomContainer("platinum"))->Import("platinum.cry");
@endcode

the file "platinum.cry" must exist in the current directory.

MDSystem reimplements Import() methods, so it is able to import directly a multi-element file.
The individual element is defined by the "id" field. To enable this, the data file must have
the id definitions, in the pseudo comment "IDn", where "n" is replaced by the type id number of
the elements, starting with 0. The format of this pseudo comment is:

@code
#$ IDn <name> <material>
@endcode

The data file will look like:

@code
#$ ID0 hot argon
#$ ID1 cool platinum
#$ Fields x y z vx vy vz id xid --
0.00000 0.00000 -82.30500 7.93743e-01 -8.57157e+00 5.12989e+00 0 1
2.65500 2.65500 -82.30500 8.04331e+00 -4.94380e+00 -3.21549e+00 0 1
...
58.86000 58.86000 -86.92200 0.00000e+00 0.00000e+00 0.00000e+00 1 2 
60.82200 60.82200 -86.92200 0.00000e+00 0.00000e+00 0.00000e+00 1 2 
@endcode

in this example, atoms with id=0 will take properties from "def.argon", and
id=1 from "def.platinum" file. The creation function will simply be:

@code
void CreateSystem() {
  Import("system.cry");
}
@endcode

"system.cry" is the exemplary file name of the crystal data.
